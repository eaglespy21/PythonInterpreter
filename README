Project description: Python interpreter that interprets functions and arithmetics operations. Activation records created for functions in the symbol table. 
Table Manager implemented that pushes and pops scopes for functions and creates chain of symbol tables. Print nodes, assignment nodes and call nodes created new, from lastproject.  

Difficulties: Changing the last project to include parsing of functions. 
In theory and logically the project was easy to understand but implementing it was much harder especially because of the python grammar. 

Extra: 
testArith.py is the testHarness to use it is similar to the last project. 
cases/ contains all the test cases including basic functions, return statement and global statement 
All the new test cases are in cases/ folder, they have 'func' in their file names.
